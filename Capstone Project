This project uses IoT sensors to collect real-time farm data like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. A digital twin (virtual model of the farm) is created to monitor field conditions.
Using predictive analytics, the system helps farmers make better decisions about irrigation, crop health, and yield. This improves productivity and supports smart and sustainable farming.
